== Introduction ==
connect360 allows your XBox 360 to connect to your Linux-based computer. It is in a superalpha state and is far from being bug-free.

== Compiling ==
To compile connect360, you need to have the libupnp, ffmpeg, and libid3tag development libraries installed on your system. After those are installed, you should be able to perform  a simple *make* to compile the program.

== Configuration ==
Right now there is only one config file: *connect360.cfg*. Place the paths to your media in this file. 

== Running ==
Simply run *connect360* in a console to start the program.

== Supported Types ==
Right now the only media supported by connect360 is the media directly supported by the XBox 360 (ie: Windows Media Video/Audio, MP3). I plan on adding in a transcoder to allow for more media types to be supported.
